# Etch-a-Sketch

Welcome to Etch-a-Sketch!

This project aims to recreate the classic 1960s drawing toy Etch-a-Sketch, but in digital form using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Other tools used:
  
  * Github Pages for free hosting
  * Git for version control
  * Figma for mockup
  * Chrome DevTools for debugging
  * Visual Studio Code for IDE

### Motivation
To practice and refine my Javascript and CSS fundamentals

### My Learnings
* Value of conditional statements
* Value of loops
* Importance of functions, event listeners and DOM manipulation
* Importance of a CSS reset
* Some form elements are harder to style than others because of built-in styling per browser and may lead to inconsistencies

### Known Issues
* Not mobile responsive
* Draw does not work with touch screens
* Styling inconsistencies with slider on different browsers
